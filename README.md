## 🧠 What I Learned

This project was built to master core React concepts:

- **State Management**: Using `useState` for tasks, input values, and UI state.
- **Side Effects**: Using `useEffect` for local storage synchronization and theme toggling.
- **Conditional Rendering**: Dynamically displaying modals and empty states.
- **Component Architecture**: Breaking down the UI into reusable logic.
